SMITH v. JONES CORPORATION
    
United States District Court, Southern District of California
Filed: March 15, 2020

BACKGROUND

This case involves a wrongful termination claim. The plaintiff, Jane Smith, was employed by Jones Corporation from January 2018 to December 2019.

LEGAL STANDARD

Under California Labor Code § 2922, employment relationships are presumed to be at-will unless modified by contract. An at-will employee may be terminated for any lawful reason or no reason at all.

However, wrongful termination claims can proceed when termination violates public policy. See Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167 (1980).

ANALYSIS

The plaintiff alleges she was terminated in retaliation for reporting safety violations to OSHA. Retaliation for reporting workplace safety concerns violates public policy.

The court finds that plaintiff has stated a cognizable claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

CONCLUSION

Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED. This case will proceed to discovery.
